The comment primarily consists of two central drug-related perspectives. First, the speaker shares their personal experience regarding dosing and its effects ("I'm only sleepy when I'm on too high of a dose and I'm 4 years in"), which establishes a first-person perspective. Second, the speaker directly addresses another individual by advising them to check their dosing ("you might want to check dosing, you may be on too high of a dose or vice versa"), which constitutes a second-person perspective. Both the personal account and the advice to another person are central to the drug-related discussion, whereas there is no focus on a third-person perspective.
