      "1. The person starts with a suggestion to another person: \"you might want to check dosing, you may be on too high of a dose or vice versa.\" This indicates they are addressing someone else and discussing that person's opioid dosing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Then they mention their own experience: \"im only sleepy when I'm on too high of a dose and I'm 4 years in,\" which indicates past or ongoing personal use, emphasizing their experience over four years.\n",

      "These perspectives map directly onto the given conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The first part of the comment includes a second-person perspective, addressing 'you':\n",
      "  - Thus, we will set position 2 (second person) to 1.\n",
      "- The second part of the comment includes a first-person perspective, reflecting on the speaker's own experience:\n",
      "  - Thus, we will set position 1 (first person) to 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since there is no mention of a third-person perspective, we set the third position to 0.\n",
