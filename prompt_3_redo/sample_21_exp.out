The comment directly advises another person to reconsider taking more Xanax (second person) and also describes the severe withdrawal experiences faced by people in the hospital, including alcohol and fentanyl withdrawals (third person). There is no mention of the speakerâ€™s personal experience, making perspectives two and three central to the drug-related message.

The comment centrally addresses multiple perspectives related to drug withdrawals. It directly advises another individual using second-person pronouns ("You should REALLY rethink taking more"), shares the speaker's collective experience in a professional setting with first-person plural ("our most difficult withdrawals in the hospital"), and provides general information about the dangers of withdrawals affecting others ("People can die from seizures"). All three perspectives are integral to the main drug-related message of the comment.

The comment directly addresses the reader using the second person ("You should REALLY rethink taking more") and discusses the experiences of others ("People can die from seizures," "Alcohol and Xanax are our most difficult withdrawals in the hospital"). These elements are central to the drug-related message, focusing on advice and describing withdrawal challenges faced by individuals and groups. While "our" is used, it references a collective experience rather than the speaker's personal account, so the first person perspective is not marked.

The comment directly addresses another individual with the directive "You should REALLY rethink taking more," making the second person perspective central to the drug-related message. While it mentions "people" and "our" in discussing withdrawals, these references serve to support the primary advice and do not shift the main focus away from addressing the individual.

The comment primarily addresses another individual by advising them to "RETHINK taking more," using the second-person pronoun "you." Although it includes general information about withdrawals and mentions "our" experience in the hospital, the central drug-related message revolves around directly advising someone else regarding Xanax use.
