The comment primarily discusses the experiences of patients ("pts") suffering from severe pain and how societal perceptions about pain medication contribute to their unnecessary suffering and potential self-harm. It uses third-person references like "pts" and "ppl" to describe others' drug-related experiences. There is no personal account from the speaker (first person) nor direct addressing of another individual (second person), making the third-person perspective central to the drug-related narrative.
