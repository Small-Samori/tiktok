The comment's primary focus is on the speaker's personal experience with addiction and their decision to remain clean. Phrases like "I’m a addict and chose to awaken the beast now I choose to stay clean" clearly center on the speaker's own journey. While the comment uses "you" when stating "Cancer is a disease you can’t choose," this is used illustratively to contrast cancer with addiction and does not serve as a direct address central to the drug-related message.
