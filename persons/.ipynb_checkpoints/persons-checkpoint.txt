I broke 4 ribs,I was given 30 TylenolW/Cod. It did absolutely nothing for pain. Ibuprofen gave me a tiny bit of relief.i was surprised.

He isn’t wrong. Ive done every opiate under the sun. Tianeptine withdrawal is like coming off of fent, xanax, and ssri’s all at once

Because there’s too much money to be made with alcohol. I went through withdrawals and had to detox off of alcohol and benzos. It was miserable

Cymbalta withdrawal was the worst thing I've gone through. Months of pure hell.

8 people died and my son died the same week in the same area to black market fentanyl laced zanax. He had been trying to get help for insomnia and adhd. He worked for CCC of Ca found in gov bunk dead.

I’ve had 3 good friends die from shit laced with fentanyl. And a dozen more other ppl from my town I know who died from it. 🥺🥺

How do I go about getting involved with this??? My baby dad died in 2021 to an accidental OD, pills laced with fentanyl🥲

Cancer is a disease you can’t choose it addiction is a choice I’m a addict and chose to awaken the beast now I choose to stay clean just saying

18 years clean. you got to want to stay clean

20 year meth addict here...never attempted to get sober before...I'm 10 months sober today❤️

You should be proud! That's an amazing accomplishment and congrats! You're an amazing warrior! Keep Going! 💪

What an amazing beautiful transformation Im so proud of you & your testimony 🥰

Your son did not mean to, “overdose”, and die. He was murdered by fentanyl laced drugs!!!!!

Grief is a very tricky and painful process, maybe just say I’m sorry for your loss?

healing love sent ur way babe and omg I'm so dam proud of you keep shinning!! your so brave so strong🥰

Wow this is devastating. I’m so sorry Lauri for your tremendous loss. No matter what you were going through, you always stood by your Son. May God bless you and your family thruthis difficult time. 💔

what a handsome young man, I'm so very sorry for your loss 💜

you might want to check dosing, you may be on too high of a dose or vice versa im only sleepy when I'm on too high of a dose and I'm 4 years in

they have been giving small doses of it to women when they give birth since forever

Tylenol taken daily or at high doses can cause issues too 🥺 they don’t give education when they recommend it either

You should REALLY rethink taking more. Xanax is probably one of the top two worst withdrawals! People can die from seizures. Alcohol and Xanax are our most difficult withdrawals in the hospital, +Fent

absolutely heartbreaking it needs to stop . my prayers for all the families dealing with a loss due to fentynal fuk fentynal

Accidental fentanyl overdose. He thought it was a Vicodin his friend gave him. It killed him instantly😞 Thank you friend

No, a lot of people still think that heroin or other drugs are "laced" with fentanyl. When they're JUST fentanyl. Fentanyl has replaced them.

I knew a girl that used to bully me that died from an accidental fentanyl overdose. Even though she caused me a lot of trauma, I was still very sad about her passing. She didn’t deserve that.

Rehabs will help if they want to be clean. They have to want to be clean to stay clean.

THERE'S SUCH A THING AS LEGALLY PRESCRIBED OPIOIDS. BUT PPL RARELY 'RARELY OVERDOSE OR LEGALLY RX'D OPIOIDS UNDER A DR'S CARE'IF TAKEN CORRECTLY. ONLY OPIOID NAIVE PPL MIGHT OVERDOSE. BE RESPONSIBLE

pts w/ severe pain are suffering needlessly&killing themselves bc ppl think they need pain meds for a good time more-this is trend is NOT it
