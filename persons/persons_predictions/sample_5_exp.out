The comment primarily conveys the speaker’s personal tragedy, detailing the death of their son and others due to black market fentanyl-laced Xanax. The use of first-person possessive pronouns like "my son" and "He" centers the message on the speaker’s own experience and loss. While third-person references to other deaths are mentioned, they serve to support the main narrative of the speaker’s personal account. There is no direct address to another individual, so the second-person perspective is not marked.
