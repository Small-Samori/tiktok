I\\'ll be the first one to say it was way too strong. like, I don\\'t like, not out. and it was the point where I was like, like me. see, what\\'s that one? our can left down there. you see, I used 15 of them last week. what, 15? our cans. amber.

I wanna go. I\\'m glad. I really go for samples that because you. they always do make the samples a lot stronger than what they actually bring out. because then it\\'s like, you\\'ve been a real good stuff. and everyone here\\'s the strong, the same. everyone\\'s gonna go for it. and it\\'s like, okay when they get there, and it\\'s like, terrible, but yeah. no, there\\'s one down. yeah. like Somerset\",\"create_time\":1673641092,\"hashtag_names\":[\"tranq\",\"kensington\",\"streetsofphiladephia\",\"fentanylkills\",\"fentanylawareness\",\"kensingtonphilly\"],\"region_code\":\"us\"},{\"create_time\":1673640813,\"hashtag_names\":[],\"region_code\":\"us\",\"username\":\"aaron_duhhhhh\"},{\"region_code\":\"us\",\"username\":\"jeffshighonlife\",\"voice_to_text\":\"all right.
